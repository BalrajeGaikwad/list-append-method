    List Methods
    Letâ€™s look at different list methods in Python:

    1) append(): Adds an element to the end of the list.
    2) copy(): Returns a shallow copy of the list.
    3) clear(): Removes all elements from the list.
    4) count(): Returns the number of times a specified element appears in the list.
    5) extend(): Adds elements from another list to the end of the current list.
    6) index(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element.
    7) insert(): Inserts an element at a specified position.
    8) pop(): Removes and returns the element at the specified position (or the last element if no index is specified).
    9) remove(): Removes the first occurrence of a specified element.
    10) reverse(): Reverses the order of the elements in the list.
    11) sort(): Sorts the list in ascending order
